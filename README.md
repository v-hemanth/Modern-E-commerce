# Modern-E-commerce
This is a Modern E-commerce application built using AbanteCart and Microsoft Azure Services for my Future Ready Talent Internship.

AbanteCart is a CMS software similar to Wordpress built specifically for ecommerce websites. It is open source and has numerous extensions which the users can integrate to their own applications.

Microsoft Azure Services like Virtual machine with adept configurations to get  the best possible pricing model were used in deploying the application. Network watcher, network security group and also SSH key configurations were added for increased security.

The general idea of this ecommerce application is that it has two modules a customer or an end user module and an admin module.\
The customer can view all the products, add products to cart, create accounts and view their order history and even subscribe to newsletter etc.,.

The admin can view the statistical data regarding the number of orders, customers, reviews etc.\
He needs to approve the user accounts for their successful acutivation and he can change and monitor the customer data.\
He can edit that is either add, delete or modify information regarding the categories of products present in the application, the number of products their cost and even their quantity details etc.\
He can also change the layout and information of any particular field in the web application.\
The admin can also add sales and coupons which can be used by the customer during special sale seasons.\
The admin can perform all the above mentioned tasks using the admin dashboard once he logs in with the correct credentials.


The website is quick, available and responsive with an elegant look. It also has feature extensions like payments linked with paypal etc which can be used based on the developers need.
