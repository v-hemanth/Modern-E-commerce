# Modern-E-commerce
This is a Modern E-commerce application built using AbanteCart and Microsoft Azure Services for my Future Ready Talent Internship.

AbanteCart is a CMS software similar to Wordpress built specifically for ecommerce websites. It is open source and has numerous extensions which the users can integrate to their own applications.

The core Azure Services used in this project were:
Azure Virtual Machine
Azure Virtual Network
Azure Network Watcher
Azure Disk Storage
Network Security Group

Deploying your appication through Virtual Machine provides you with complete control over its confifurations, scalabilty and availabilty factors which I made use of to produce a model with the best price configuration possible for a dev/test based website.
